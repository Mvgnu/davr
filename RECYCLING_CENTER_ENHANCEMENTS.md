## 🏗️ Architecture & Best Practices

### Component Structure
```
components/recycling-centers/
├── CenterHero.tsx           (Enhanced with images)
├── OpeningHours.tsx         (New - displays hours)
├── MaterialsList.tsx        (New - searchable list)
└── NearbyCentersSection.tsx (New - nearby centers)
```

### Key Principles Applied
1. **No Mock Data**: All components use real database data
2. **No TODOs**: Complete implementations only
3. **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
5. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels
6. **Performance**: Client-side interactivity where needed, server-side data fetching
7. **Error States**: Graceful handling of missing data
8. **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and feedback

### Data Flow
```
Server Component (page.tsx)
  ↓ Fetches from Prisma
  ↓ Calculates distances
  ↓ Passes props
Client Component (ClientRecyclingCenterDetail.tsx)
  ↓ Renders layout
  ↓ Distributes data to child components
Child Components
  ↓ Handle interactivity (search, expand/collapse)
  ↓ Maintain client-side state
```

## 📊 Database Schema Support

### Required Fields (all existing):
- `RecyclingCenter.image_url` - For hero images
- `RecyclingCenter.description` - For hero description
- `RecyclingCenter.working_hours` - For opening hours
- `Material.image_url` - For material list
- Coordinates (lat/lng) - For nearby centers

### Relationships Used:
- Center → Working Hours (one-to-many)
- Center → Offers → Materials (many-to-many through)
- Center → Center (self-referential for nearby)

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before vs After:

**Materials Section:**
- Before: Long vertical list, takes up 70% of page
- After: Searchable, shows 3 items, expandable, includes images

**Sidebar:**
- Before: "Send Message" button, static info
- After: Opening hours, contact info, address, proper spacing

**Hero:**
- Before: Text-only header
- After: Full-width image hero with overlay or beautiful fallback

**Navigation:**
- Before: Single center view
- After: Easy discovery of nearby centers for comparison

**Material Details:**
- Before: Just name and price
- After: Images, descriptions, comparison links

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### For Developers:
```typescript
// The page automatically fetches enhanced data
const center = await fetchRecyclingCenter(slug);
// Includes: offers, working_hours, nearbyCenters

// Pass to client component
<ClientRecyclingCenterDetail
  centerData={center}
  params={params}
/>
```

### For Users:
1. View beautiful hero image/fallback
2. Read opening hours in sidebar
3. Search through materials
4. Click "Preise vergleichen" to compare prices
5. Discover nearby centers
6. Jump to map section
7. Contact center

## 🧪 Testing Completed
