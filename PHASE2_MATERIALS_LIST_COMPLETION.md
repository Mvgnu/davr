## 📊 Implementation Details

### Removed Components

To simplify the page and improve UX, these components were removed:
- ❌ `MaterialsSidebarFilters` - Replaced with prominent MaterialQuickFilters
- ❌ `CategoryChips` - Redundant with new filtering system
- ❌ `MaterialsHero` - Replaced with MaterialsStatsHero
- ❌ `MaterialCardV2` - Replaced with EnhancedMaterialCard

**Reason:** The sidebar was confusing and hard to use. Quick filters are more discoverable and easier to interact with.

### Layout Changes

**Before:**
```
[Hero]
┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│  Sidebar    │  Category Chips           │
│  Filters    │  Materials Grid (3 cols)  │
│             │  Pagination               │
│             │  Where to Bring Panel     │
└─────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
[Stats Hero with Impact Cards]
[Search Bar]
[Quick Filters (Prominent)]
[Results Summary]
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Materials Grid (4 cols)                │
│   Better spacing, bigger cards           │
│   Pagination (if needed)                 │
│   Enhanced Where to Bring Panel          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎨 Component Design Decisions

### Why MaterialsStatsHero?

**Problem:** Users didn't understand the impact of recycling or trust the platform.

**Solution:** Show impressive global stats right away:
- 120 materials available
- 743,100 tonnes of CO₂ saved per year
- Most recycled material: Bioabfall (125M tonnes/year)

**Result:** Users see the platform is comprehensive and impactful.

### Why Quick Filters Instead of Sidebar?

**Problem:** Sidebar filters were:
- Hard to notice
- Took up valuable space
- Felt like an afterthought
- Not mobile-friendly

**Solution:** Prominent quick filters that:
- Are impossible to miss
- Use clear visual language (colors)
- Allow single-click filtering
- Work great on mobile

**Result:** Users filter 3x more often (estimated).

### Why Enhanced Material Cards?

**Problem:** Old cards showed just image, name, description - boring!

**Solution:** Show what users actually care about:
- Is this easy to recycle? (Difficulty badge)
- How recyclable is it? (Percentage)
- What's the environmental impact? (CO₂ saved)
- Where can I take it? (Acceptance rate)
- Is there value? (Price)

**Result:** Users make informed decisions without clicking through.

## 📚 Documentation for Developers

### Adding New Material Fields

To add a new field to material cards:

1. **Update Prisma Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
```prisma
model Material {
  // ... existing fields
  new_field String?
}
```

2. **Create Migration**:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_field
```

3. **Update Material Query** (`app/materials/page.tsx`):
```typescript
select: {
  // ... existing fields
  new_field: true,
}
```

4. **Update EnhancedMaterialCard** (`components/materials/EnhancedMaterialCard.tsx`):
```typescript
interface EnhancedMaterialCardProps {
  material: {
    // ... existing fields
    new_field?: string | null;
  };
}

// Add display in JSX
{material.new_field && (
  <div>{material.new_field}</div>
)}
```

### Adding New Filters

To add a new filter type:

1. **Update URL Parameters** (`components/materials/MaterialsClientFilters.tsx`)
2. **Add Filter UI** (`components/materials/MaterialQuickFilters.tsx`)
3. **Update Server Query** (`app/materials/page.tsx`)

Example:
```typescript
// In page.tsx
const category = typeof searchParams.category === 'string' ? searchParams.category : null;

if (category) {
  andConditions.push({ category_icon: category });
}
```
