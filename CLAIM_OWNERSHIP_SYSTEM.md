- admin_response: String? (admin's feedback message)
- reviewed_by_id: String? (which admin reviewed)
- reviewed_at: DateTime? (when reviewed)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Optional user_id?
Allows anonymous users to claim centers without creating account first. Admin can create account during approval if needed.

### Why Store Documents as JSON?
- Flexible structure for multiple documents
- Easy to add metadata (filename, size, type)
- No need for separate documents table
- Simple serialization/deserialization

### Why Generate Password Instead of Email Magic Link?
- Simpler implementation
- Immediate access after approval
- Admin can communicate credentials directly
- User can change password on first login

### Why Three Review Actions?
- **Approve**: Clear acceptance path
- **Reject**: Clear rejection with reason
- **Request More Info**: Avoids premature rejection, allows clarification

### Why Show Credentials to Admin?
- Admin may need to communicate via phone/in-person
- Ensures credentials are sent via preferred channel
- Fallback if email fails
- Creates paper trail for support

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **File Storage**: Local filesystem (public/uploads)
   - For production: Consider AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.
   - Add CDN for faster delivery
   - Implement cleanup for old/unused files

2. **Database Queries**:
   - Indexed on: status, user_id, recycling_center_id, reviewed_by_id
   - Uses `include` for eager loading (avoids N+1)
   - Ordered queries for consistent results

3. **Client-Side**:
   - Loading states prevent double-submissions
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Debounced search (if added)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email System**: Integration with email service
2. **Notifications**: In-app notification system
3. **Claim History**: Show claim history on center page
4. **Bulk Actions**: Approve/reject multiple claims
5. **Export**: CSV export of claims data
6. **Analytics**: Claim approval rates, time to review
7. **Webhooks**: Notify external systems of approvals
8. **Document Preview**: In-browser PDF viewer
9. **OCR**: Extract text from uploaded IDs for verification
10. **2FA**: Require 2FA for admin review actions

---

**Implementation Complete**: All core functionality working, tested, and ready for production deployment.
**Next Steps**: Integrate email service provider and implement notification templates.
