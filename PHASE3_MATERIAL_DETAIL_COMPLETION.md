## 🎨 Component Design Decisions

### Why Two-Column Layout?

**Problem:** Too much information overwhelms users in single column.

**Solution:** Split into main content (2/3) and sidebar (1/3):
- Main: Core info users came for (impact, preparation, journey)
- Sidebar: Supporting info (fun fact, hierarchy)

**Result:** Clear hierarchy, easier to scan, better use of wide screens.

### Why Animated Visualizations?

**Problem:** Raw numbers are boring and hard to grasp.

**Solution:** Visualize environmental impact with:
- Expanding progress bar (CO₂)
- Circular progress graph (Energy)
- Bouncing droplets (Water)

**Result:** Numbers become tangible, memorable, sharable.

### Why Accordion for Preparation Tips?

**Problem:** 4 tips with full text creates very long page.

**Solution:** Expandable accordion:
- Shows all titles at once (scannable)
- Users expand what interests them
- First tip auto-expanded (shows pattern)

**Result:** Information is accessible but not overwhelming.

### Why Geolocation for Centers?

**Problem:** Users need to find closest centers, not just any center.

**Solution:** Request location and sort by distance:
- Shows closest first
- Distance badges help decision-making
- Gracefully degrades if location denied

**Result:** Users find relevant centers faster.

## 📚 Documentation for Developers

### Adding New Material Fields to Detail Page

To add a new field to the detail page:

1. **Update Database Query** (`app/materials/[slug]/page.tsx`):
```typescript
const material = await prisma.material.findUnique({
  select: {
    // ... existing fields
    new_field: true,
  },
});
```

2. **Update MaterialDetail Type**:
```typescript
type MaterialDetail = {
  // ... existing fields
  new_field: string | null;
};
```

3. **Create or Update Component**:
```typescript
// Pass to existing component
<SomeComponent newField={material.new_field} />

// Or create new component
<NewFieldDisplay value={material.new_field} />
```

### Creating New Animated Visualizations

Example: Adding a "Recycling Rate Over Time" chart

1. **Create Component** (`components/materials/RecyclingRateChart.tsx`):
```typescript
'use client';

export default function RecyclingRateChart({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-xl p-6">
      {/* SVG or canvas chart with animations */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. **Add to Detail Page**:
```typescript
<div className="lg:col-span-2">
  {material.recycling_rate_history && (
    <RecyclingRateChart data={material.recycling_rate_history} />
  )}
</div>
```
