## 📝 Notes for Phase 2

**Data Available for UI:**
- Recyclability percentage → Progress bars, badges
- Recycling difficulty → Color-coded indicators
- Category icons → Visual categorization
- Environmental impact → Stats cards with impact data
- Preparation tips → Expandable tip cards
- Fun facts → Engaging content blocks
- Pricing → Market value indicators
- Acceptance rate → Center availability info

**Component Props Structure:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedMaterialCardProps {
  material: {
    name: string;
    slug: string;
    image_url: string | null;
    recyclability_percentage: number | null;
    category_icon: string | null;
    average_price_per_unit: number | null;
    price_unit: string | null;
    environmental_impact: {
      co2_saved_per_kg: number;
    } | null;
    acceptance_rate: number | null;
  };
}
```

**Design Considerations:**
- Use progress bars for recyclability (0-100%)
- Color code difficulty (green=EASY, yellow=MEDIUM, red=HARD)
- Show CO2 savings prominently
- Display price with currency formatting
- Icons from lucide-react based on category_icon field
