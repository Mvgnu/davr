# Development Plan

This document outlines the remaining development tasks for the DAVR Application Restoration, based on the initial analysis and `restoration-plan.md`. Work will proceed autonomously following the principles in `principles.md`.

## Phase 1: Core Structure and Authentication (Priority: HIGHEST)

- [x] Recreate root `layout.tsx`.
- [x] Rebuild homepage (`page.tsx`).
- [x] Restore auth pages (`/app/auth/*`).
- [x] Restore API auth routes (`/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`, `/register`, `/me`).
- [x] Restore `middleware.ts` for route protection.

## Phase 2: Complete Feature APIs & User Profiles (Priority: HIGH)

- [x] Restore Marketplace item API (`/app/api/marketplace/[id]/route.ts`).
- [x] Restore Admin Marketplace API (`/app/api/admin/marketplace/route.ts`).
- [x] Restore Admin Users API (`/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`).
- [x] Rebuild user profile pages (`/app/profile/*`).

## Phase 3: Testing and Finalization (Priority: HIGH)

- [ ] Resolve Next.js config warnings.
- [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly.
- [ ] Verify all permission checks across roles and resources.
- [ ] Test core Recycling Centers features (listings, details, buy materials).
- [ ] Test core Marketplace features (listings, details, item management).

## Phase 5: Technical Debt and Refinement (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] Implement stricter TypeScript types for APIs and components.
- [ ] Implement responsive design fixes/enhancements for mobile devices.
- [ ] Enhance search functionality (autocomplete, relevance).
- [ ] Refine filter components based on recent changes.
- [ ] General performance optimization (loading times, bundle size).

## Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup (Priority: LOW)

- [ ] Update README.md with current setup and features.
- [ ] Review and clean up unused code or components.
- [ ] Ensure consistency in code style and documentation.
