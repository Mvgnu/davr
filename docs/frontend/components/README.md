## Guidelines

*   Components should be well-documented using TSDoc/JSDoc within their source files.
*   Focus on reusability, accessibility, and adherence to the design system.
*   For complex components, consider creating a dedicated subdirectory here with its own `README.md` detailing props, usage, and examples.
